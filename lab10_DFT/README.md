# Laboratory 10 - DFT

## Task 1 - DFT, IDFT, FFT implementations
Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and Inverse DFT (IDFT) are classical and ineffective ways of calculating 
Fourier's transform, having complexity of O(n^2). FFT with Cooley-Turkey algorithm is also implemented, 
having much better complexity of O(nlog(n)).

## Task 2 - 1D DFT in signal processing
DFT can be easily seen and interpreted in 1D, changing the domain of signals from time to frequency. Real and imaginary 
parts are plotted for signals on separate plots.
