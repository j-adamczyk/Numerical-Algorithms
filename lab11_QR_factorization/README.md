# Laboratory 11 - QR factorization

## Task 1 - Gram-Schmidt method
This simple method factorizes a matrix into QR matrix multiplication using Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization method.

## Task 2 - solving equations systems
QR method can be used for solving equations systems (not necessarily linear), especially overdetermined ones. It can 
also be used for least squares approximation e. g. for functions given by matrices.
