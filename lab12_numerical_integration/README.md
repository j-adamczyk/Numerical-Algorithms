# Laboratory 12 - numerical integration

Tasks 1 and 2 are simple 1D implementations of trapezoid rule and composite Simpson's rule.
Task 3 is 2D trapezoid rule with adaptive mesh density, using arbitrary Python functions passed as objects. 
Interestingly, it works better than out-of-the-box SciPy integration for test functions.
