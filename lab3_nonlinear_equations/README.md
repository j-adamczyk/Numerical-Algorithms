# Laboratory 3 - non-linear equations solvers

Three classical non-linear equation solvers are implemented:
  - bisection method
  - Newton's method
  - secant method

Note that derivatives for Newton's method are calculated by hand for test functions and in practice symbolic calculations 
library like SymPy should be used to calculate them from functions passed as arguments.
