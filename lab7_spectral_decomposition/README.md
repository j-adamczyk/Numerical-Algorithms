# Laboratory 7 - spectral decomposition

The spectral decomposition is a method of calculating dominating eigenvalue (the largest eigenvalue in terms of absolute value) 
and its eigenvector for given matrix. Implemented methods are regular power method and inverse power method (using spectral theorem).
